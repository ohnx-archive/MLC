# make managebac great again

managebac has a weird off-gray colour that is used for text.

that is a terrible idea. I cannot imagine why on earth anyone would prefer to read off-gray on white instead of black on white.

this fixes that problem by injecting a css file that modifies the colour from the default #58646d to a much nicer #000.

ManageBac looks good! the only problem is the font color.

this is really just an experiment with chrome extensions before I go do something more complex.
